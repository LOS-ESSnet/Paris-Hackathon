# Linked Open Statistics — Paris Hackathon #
### 10 September 2018 - 14 September 2018

This pages give information about the LOS hackathon that will take place in Paris in September 2018.

## General information

The hackathon is organized in the framework of the [Linked Open Statistics ESSnet](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cros/content/linked-open-statistics_en). Its main objectives are to:
  * Develop programs to create or enrich RDF statistical datasets;
  * Create RDF links between those datasets and other data;
  * Develop programs that use the datasets in a valuable way (query, explore, visualize, export, etc.);
  * Evaluate or test software packages that perform all or part of the previous activities.

The hackathon is structured in two tracks:
  * The "Produce" track will focus on creating, linking, and otherwise enriching RDF data sets.
  * The "Consume" track will be devoted to using the RDF data sets by building tools to visualize, query, explore, import or export them.
